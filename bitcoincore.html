<p>A bitcoin node is required in order to interact with the global bitcoin network. If you do not use your own node then you are using someone else’s node, trusting them with both your privacy and verification that the expected rules of the network are followed.</p>
<p>The easiest way to run and use a bitcoin node is to simply install bitcoin core on a computer you already own. You can then use Sparrow Wallet on the same computer to use it with your hardware wallets. We will go through those steps below.</p>
<p><strong>requirements:</strong> a computer with at least 750 GB of free disk space, SSDs are preferred over HDDs for their superior performance</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/">Bitcoin Core</a></li>
