<ul>
<li>bitcoin transaction fees limit network abuse by making usage expensive</li>
<li>there is a cost to every transaction, set by a dynamic free market based on demand</li>
<li>it is an incredibly robust way to prevent spam without relying on centralized entities that can be corrupted or pressured</li>
<li>when bitcoin blocks are full, highest fee transactions are confirmed first</li>
<li>pending transactions sit in node mempools awaiting confirmation: can conceptualize mempools as a line to enter a restaurant sorted by who is willing to pay the most</li>
<li>if you are willing to wait for your transaction to confirm you can pay significantly lower fees</li>
<li>your bitcoin wallet may show a single balance but the reality is that it is made of many different unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs)</li>
<li>when you make a bitcoin transaction your wallet will select as many UTXOs as necessary to reach the amount of bitcoin you wish to send</li>
<li>onchain transaction fees are calculated based on size in bytes not the amount of sats sent</li>
<li>the more UTXOs required on the input side the higher the fee paid</li>
<li>from a cost perspective you want to consolidate UTXOs, fewer UTXOs with larger amounts</li>
<li>consolidation has privacy tradeoffs though: you link any UTXOs you consolidate as owned by the same person + larger UTXOs mean you will dox more of your stack to anyone you pay in the future</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Therefore you want to reduce the number of UTXOs you have while being mindful of the privacy concerns.</strong></p>
<p>Lightning Transaction fees are calculated differently: based on the amount in sats sent. Opening <a href="https://www.discreetlog.com/the-lightning-network-does-not-exist/">lightning channels</a> when fees are low can enable you to save money in the future when fees rise. 🤙</p>
