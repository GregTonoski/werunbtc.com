<ul>
<li>when bitcoin blocks are full, highest fee transactions are confirmed first</li>
<li>your bitcoin wallet may show a single balance but the reality is that it is made of many different unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs)</li>
<li>when you make a bitcoin transaction your wallet will select as many UTXOs as necessary to reach the amount of bitcoin you wish to send</li>
<li>onchain transaction fees are calculated based on size in bytes not the amount of sats sent</li>
<li>the more utxos required on the input side the higher the fee paid</li>
<li>from a cost perspective you want to consolidate utxos, fewer utxos with larger amounts</li>
<li>consolidation has privacy tradeoffs though: you link any UTXOs you consolidate as owned by the same person + larger UTXOs mean you will dox more of your stack to anyone you pay in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore you want to reduce the number of UTXOs you have while being mindful of the privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Lightning Transaction fees are calculated differently: based on the amount in sats sent. Opening lightning channels when fees are low can enable you to save money in the future when fees rise. 🤙</p>
